## IoT_AnomalyDetection

This is an assignment for Data Mining (CO3029).

The team experienced with different models for the same dataset IoT23, and attempted to make adjustments to the baseline models in order to improve results using lower-performace computers.

This repo contains 4 Jupyter Notebook for 4 different models: SVM, CNN, Naives Bayes and Decision Trees.
